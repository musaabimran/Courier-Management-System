# Courier-Management-System
The Pakistan Post wishes to develop a system that works for their day-to-day 
operations. The Pakistan Post is organized in the following way.
There are several post offices each of them has some unique code and address and 
collection centers each of which processes documents/ parcels to deliver such as 
letters, packets, etc. 
Mail has various services such as same day, one day, urgent and regular. Same-day 
mail service is for local vicinity, one day for other neighbour cities. Similarly, urgent 
mail service has extra charges of 20% compared to the regular mail service. 
An invoice will be issued for every parcel. The invoice has a unique order ID and all 
the information related to the parcel/document which includes their weight, 
dimensions, shipment time, the address of the sender and receiver as well as contact 
details of both. So that if the receiver did not receive the shipment it will be returned 
to the sender. 
There are multiple sections of the post office like the shipment section that takes the 
parcel/document stamped and sets it for sent to the destination. The parcel-deliver 
section will receive the shipments from other post offices (cities, countries) then 
enter them into their system and at the end, they will hand over to the postman. The 
not-shipped section will maintain the undelivered package and its record. 
The sorting section sorts the mails in such a way that every mail that belongs to the 
same city/country is put in the same bag. Then sent to the GPO of that city, the GPO 
then further sort on the basis of local vicinity. The accounts section maintain the 
accounts related services. 
At Post Office, you have to buy the postal stamps for your document/parcel. These 
postal stamps have some specific price i.e. Rs.5, 10,20, 50, 100. The variation in the 
number of postal stamps is being used for parcel/document that depends upon the 
nature of the parcel/document i.e. the number of tickets and their price may vary 
because of their weight or based on distance (local, national, international). Tickets/ 
stamps will be solved without invoice but one invoice will be issued for all stamps 
sold in a day. Reports can show various categories of various parcels and tickets.
Postal-Workers are used for managing all types of mail services. The clerk stamps 
the postal documents/parcel and then dispatch them. The postman delivers the parcel 
to its destination. The Head of each Pakistan Post will finalize financial collections 
every day and submit them to the local GPO of each city. Pakistan Post handles the 
returned and bounced mails as well.
Mails from other cities and countries are first received at the GPO then they are 
distributed to the different post offices based on their postal codes. 
Customers (Senders) can track his/ her mail on a system with all confirmations and 
expected duration. Senders and recipient addresses will also store in the file system 
for future purposes. Search can be managed with some choices to extract data of 
Customers along with financial collections.
At present, the Pakistan Post has a manual record system but this needs 
rationalization.

customers mails and other entities.

goes for the postal workers.
